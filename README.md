We will learn and execute the following points:

- Getting started and Data Set up
- Work with Data in a popular Structure (Train, Validation, Test)
- Clean the Input Data Set - remove the images that are not images
- Apply concepts of Data Bunch for Image Classification
- Apply concepts of Normalization, Batch Size, Data Augmentation(GPU)
- Apply concepts of Learners, Architecture and Transfer Learning
- Fit Model on Training Data, Check results on Validation Data, Save Model
- terpret Model Performance using loss function, Confusion Matrix
- Improve Model performance with Differential Learning Rate
- Improve model performance with Cleaning Labels
- Apply Data Augmentation to further improve performance
- Apply Model on Single Image(GPU/CPU)
- What can go wrong and how to fix it ?
- Use Model in Production
